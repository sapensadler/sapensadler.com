Hi there! I'm Simon.

I live in the east of england and work in I.T. I'm a Systems Engineer - that means different things to many different people, but I basically design, build and test things in the I.T. industry. This can involve anything from writing software to building a big data platform. I also like beating people up (not really) - I've been practicing karate since 2000.

## Systems Engineer

I work in I.T. as a Systems Engineer, but the skill I use most, and the skill I've been developing most throughout my career is problem solving. I have a strong background in Computer Science, Software Engineering and managing Linux infranstructure. I really enjoy learning new things, particularly in the tech world. There's so much it's impossible to learn it all. I continue to challenge myself and learn new things - that's why I find the tech industry so interesting, the landscape is constantly changing.<

## Karate

I've been practicing shotokan karate a long time and have achieved the rank of sandan.
