My first post is about building this website. I set out to learn how DNS worked and ended up creating this website so I could test it. I also ended up playing with ansible to automate the deployment the DNS servers.

I've also started to learn openstack. Perhaps I could automate this further using ansible/Heat templates to fully automate it as well as deployment of this website. I'd need to work out how to update the nameserver GLUE records - perhaps there an API for that. Anyway, that's something I might be working on in the future&hellip; I should also setup SSl certs for this site. [Lets' Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) looks promising.
