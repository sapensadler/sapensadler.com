      <description>I recently started looking at ansible. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a playbook to install a master/slave dns-server for my domain. I was surprised at how easy it was to setup. Having used puppet and seeing the overhead of running a puppet agent/master, this was much quicker to get started with. Puppet has it&amp;rsquo;s place (particularly in large scale environments), but ansible wins in terms of simplicity and ease of use to learn get stared with.</description>

      <description>My first post is about building this website. I set out to learn how DNS worked and ended up creating this website so I could test it. I also ended up playing with ansible to automate the deployment the DNS servers.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also started to learn openstack. Perhaps I could automate this further using ansible/Heat templates to fully automate it as well as deployment of this website. I&amp;rsquo;d need to work out how to update the nameserver GLUE records - perhaps there an API for that.</description>
