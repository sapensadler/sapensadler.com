      <description>I recently started looking at ansible. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a playbook to install a master/slave dns-server for my domain. I was surprised at how easy it was to setup. Having used puppet and seeing the overhead of running a puppet agent/master, this was much quicker to get started with. Puppet has it&amp;rsquo;s place (particularly in large scale environments), but ansible wins in terms of simplicity and ease of use to learn get stared with.</description>
